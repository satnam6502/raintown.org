# Saag

<p align="center"> <img src="saag.jpg"></p>

* 1.2kg of greens e.g. baby spinach leaves, broccoli rabe, brussels sprouts, mustard greens and a fistfull of cilantro. Fresh methi (fenugreek leaves) if possible, some dried otherwise. Buy whatever is cheap and in season.
* 20g sea salt (or 40g of Kosher salt).
* 25g Thai green chilies (or more to taste), or use 50g of serrano chillies. Remove seeds if you want to temper heat.
* 100g of ginger, peeled and minced that goes in early into the pot.
* 50g of garlic peeled and minced that goes in early into the pot.
* 80g cornflower (poletna, masa).
* Vegetable oil for frying turka, or ghee or butter (but not olive oil).
* 75g of ginger peeled and minced that is cooked at the end for the turka.
* 30g of garlic peeled and minced for the turka at the end.
* 1 large onion (around 300g), chopped.

1. Roughly chop the greens.
2. Add the greens to a large pot (around 20cm tall or so) and add water to â…” of the height of the greens. Also add the chopped green chilies.
3. Add 20g salt, bring to boil on a HI heat on the FL burner.
4. Add 100g of peeled minced ginger and 50 of peeled minced garlic to the pot. 
5. Simmer uncovered on MED-LO on the FL burner for two or three hours until the greens have mostly reduced and broken down.
6. If the greens have not broken down enough into gloopy soft lumps then break them down further with a potato masher or hand blender, or just cook for another hour or so, adding more liquid if required. When the water has been absorbed there will no longer be pools of water rising to the top of the saag.
7. Mix enough hot water into the cornflour to form a paste and add it to the pot.
8. Add 400ml of hot water to the saag.
9. Cook until the water has been absorbed.
10. Now make the turka. Use enough vegetable oil or ghee to cover the base of a frying pan.
11. Fry the 75g of ginger and 30g or garlic until their armona is evident.
12. Add onion and cook until soft, adding a bit more oil if required.
13. When the water has been fully absorbed into the saag add the onion and ginger and garlic mixture to the pot and mix. Check for salt.
14. Enjoy with rice or make some maki di roti. I like to drop a few chunks of salted butter into the saag which slowly melt as I eat.
