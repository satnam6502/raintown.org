# Satnam's Visitor Guide To Glasgow
Sometimes I get asked for suggestions for things to do and see in Glasgow. Rather than attempting to produce an exhaustive list of things to do I've focused on a few things that I like and I expect you can easily Google the other top tourist attractions.

## Restaurants
Distincitve posh restaurants you need to book in advance.
* [The Ubiquitous Chip](https://www.ubiquitouschip.co.uk/) serves excellent dishes with a focus on the best Scottish ingredients. Do order their haggis starter.
* [Cail Bruich](https://www.cailbruich.co.uk/), currently has a Michelin star, you should take the tasting menu with wine pairing. They have a vegetarian tasting menu and can cater for pescatarians. You will need to book a month or more in advance.


Indian restaurants in the UK have a distinctive and interesting take on Indian food and I highly recommend trying a few, especially Dishoom in some other UK cities. These are some of my top picks in Glasgow:
* [Ashoka Ashton Lane](https://ashokarestaurants.com/ashoka-ashton-lane/). Order pakora, garlic naan bread and the lamb sharab masti.
* [Mother India](https://www.motherindia.co.uk/mother-india/). Good fallback plan if you can't get into an Ashoka.

The UK has the same kind of posh restaurants that you can find anywhere else in the world, but a unique aspect of the UK is that it also has pubs with a great atmosphere which server fantastic food. I strongly recommend trying a few since this is not something you can experience in any other country. For Glasgow I propose:
* [The Finnieston](https://www.thefinniestonbar.com/) Great seafood which you can wash down with a bottle of Picpoul de Pinet. Do order lots of oysters. I love their gluten free fish and chips.

Some great informal restaurants:
* [Stravaigin](https://www.stravaigin.co.uk/). Fantastic food which is often a blend of Scottish and south east Asian influences.
* [Bar Brett](https://www.barbrett.co.uk/). Astonishing wine bar specializing in natural wines and Scottish themed food, all very high quality (sister restaurant to Cail Bruich).
* [Cafe Gandolfi](https://www.cafegandolfi.com/cafe-gandolfi/). Wonderful Scottish food in lovely dinning room with great woodwork.
* [The Gannet](https://www.thegannetgla.com/). Best of Scottish ingredients in a modern presentation.

## Bars
Low key bars with plenty of locals.
* [The Belle](https://www.timeout.com/glasgow/bars-and-pubs/the-belle). Cosy west end pub.
* [The Hug and a Pint](https://www.thehugandpint.com/). Often interesting live music.
* [The Pot Still](https://thepotstill.co.uk/) Huge single malt whisky collection.

## Sights

## Walks
* Walk along the River Kelvin. Start at Kelvinbridge Underground station and follow the river up to the Botanic Gardens. Visit the  Kibble Palace greenhouse and have tea in the tearoom.
* Walk from Kelvinbridge Underground west on Great Western Road. Turn left at Byres Road and walk to Ashton Lane by the TSB bank. Turn into cobbled Ashton lane and find a place to eat or drink.
* Walk around Kelvingrove Park and Kelvin Way. Track down the statue of [Lord Kelvin](https://www.gpsmycity.com/attractions/lord-kelvin-statue-26686.html).
