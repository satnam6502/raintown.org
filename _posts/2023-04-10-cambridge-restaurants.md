# An Ad Hoc List of Cambridge Restaurants

![Kings](/images/kings.jpg)

I used to live in Cambridge UK and I still get asked for restaurant recommendations. Here is a list of restaurants I like. The list includes casual restaurants that are good for a large group with dietary restrictions, as well as highly creative restaurants that you need to book in advance. Of course there are many others that I've not been to which I am sure are also very lovely but not listed here.

* [The Architect.](https://www.thearchitectcambridge.co.uk/) A pub that serves great fish and chip, pies etc. I especially love it because it serves gluten free fish and chips, which put a celiac sufferer like me in seventh heaven. Good for a large group if you book ahead.
* [The Old Bicycle Club.](https://www.oldbicycleshop.com/) A casual restaurant with a diverse menu that can cater to a range of dietary restrictions. Good for a large group if you book ahead.
* [Fin Boys.](https://fin-boys.com/) A very good seafood restaurant that champions British fish caught from day boats.
* [Vanderlyle.](https://www.vanderlyle-restaurant.com/) A highly innovative restaurant with a plant-led tasting menu, a great choice for vegetarians and vegans. Book well in advance.
* [The Senate.](https://www.thesenatebistro.com/) A vegan friendly bistro overlooking the bustling market square of Cambridge.
* [MJP@TheShepherds](https://www.mjprestaurant.com/) This pub-style fancy restaurant just outside Cambridge serves a creative tasting menu featuring local produce.
* [The Oak Bistro.](https://www.theoakbistro.co.uk/) A solid choice for British and European classics.
* [The Kingston Arms.](https://thekingstonarms.co.uk) Neighbourhood pub serving great pub food.
* [The Three Horseshoes](https://threehorseshoesmadingley.co.uk/) Quinitessentially posh British pub serving well made British fare, just outside Cambridge.

The following Michelin starred restaurants won't serve me because I have celiac disease and need gluten free food. I've heard other people say good things about them.

* [Midsummer House.](https://midsummerhouse.co.uk/)
* [Restaurant 22.](https://www.restaurant22.co.uk/)

Restaurants I have eaten at but have chosen not to include on my list above. You might like them better than I did e.g. if unlike me you don't have celiac disease.

* [Navadhanya.](https://www.navadhanya.co.uk/) An Indian restaurant.
* [Luk Thai at the Cricketers.](https://www.lukthai.com) Thai food in a pub.
* [Hotel du Vin Bistro.](https://www.hotelduvin.com/locations/cambridge/bistro/dinner/) This used to be a favourite of mine back in the day.
* [The Ivy.](https://ivycollection.com/restaurants/the-ivy-cambridge-brasserie)
* [The Plough.](https://theploughcoton.co.uk/) Pub just to the west of Cambridge serving upscale pub food. This used to be a favourite of ours, but has taken a different turn of late.
* [The Peking.](http://www.pekingrestaurantcambridge.com) Chinese restaurant catering to British tastes.
