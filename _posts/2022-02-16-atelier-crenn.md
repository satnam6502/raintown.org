# Atelier Crenn
16 February 2022

My second visit to Dominique Crenn's San Francisco restaurant which now has three stars. We enjoyed the [Chef's Table](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80075152) Netflix program about her. I had a gluten-free multi-course pescatarian tasting menu. I also had an alcohol-free pairing.
