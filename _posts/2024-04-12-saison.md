# Saison
Friday 12 April 2024

We've been wanting to go to the legendry restaurant [Saison](https://www.saisonsf.com/) in San Francisco for many years, ever since our Cambridge days when Steve Hand would bring back signed copies from his visits there. Susan requested Saison for her birthday dinner this year so we finally took the plunge and ended up having a fantastic dinner and evening there.

I was very impressed with their gluten-free accommodation for me, which included gluten-fee bread, an alternative tempura-batter based accompaniment for the crab course and a gluten-free stroopwafel.

The standout courses for us were the geoduck and the crab, although every course was excellent. The service was extremely good, warm and welcoming without the stuffy formalism we dislike that we've encountered at other restaurants of this level. Susan had a great birthday dinner!
