# Crispy Spicy Okra
I've made this cripsy spicy okra dish for guests who said they don't like okra, but said they did like this version. I don't like slimey okra, and although the cooking process might involve a slimey stage it is important to keep cooking past this stage until the okra becomes cripsy and cruchy.

Small starter portion for 6 to 8 people.

## Ingredients
* 1kg okra.
* 1 teaspoon of salt.
* 1 teaspoon of chili powder.
* 1 teaspoon of turmeric.
* Enough melted ghee or high temperature oil to get depth of about 2mm in cast iron pan.
* A few chopped coriander leaves to scatter on top.

## Recipe 
1. In groups of four, chop off the tops of the okra and discard, then chop the remaining okra into approximately 0.8cm rings (or cut at an angle for an even better effect).
2. Heat cast iron pan until very hot on a high heat.
3. Add ghee or oil and heat until it shimmers.
4. Mix salt, chili powder and turmeric and throw into oil and mix for about 30 seconds until well combined (but donâ€™t let the spices burn).
5. Toss in the okra and mix well to get an even coverage of the spice mix.
6. Keep stirring regularly (but not constantly). At some point the okra will become slimey. Keep going, adding a little more ghee/oil if required, but be careful not to add too much. After a while the slimey stage will pass and the okra will start to crisp up and get a bit smaller. Taste a piece every so often and adjust for salt and chili powder. Keep cooking until you achieve the desired level of crispiness.
7. Divide amongst bowls and scatter coriander leaves.
