# Satnam Singh's Personal Website

This is my personal website which is mainly about cooking, food and whisky. For professional information please see my professional website [satnam6502.github.io](https://satnam6502.github.io) and [bio](https://satnam6502.github.io/bio). I'm a computer scientist living in Los Altos, California. I'm married to another computer scientist, Susan Spence. We have two children. I grew up in Scotland with a love for hiking and cycling and cooking. The picture below is taken at the restaurant [Frasca](https://www.frascafoodandwine.com/) in Boulder, Colorado.

## Raintown
This domain name is inspired by the Deacon Blue album of the same name. Glasgow is indeed a very rain town.
